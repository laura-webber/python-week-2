# sequence of immutable Python objects
# set itself is mutable but objects within are immutable
# surrounded by curly brackets
# unordered
# sets don't have indexes
# sets don't allow duplicates
flowers = {"roses", "daisies", "roses", "tulips"}

# "roses" only prints once
print(flowers)
# tip - to remove duplicates - convert list to a set then back to list, etc.
